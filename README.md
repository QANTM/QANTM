- 👋 Hi, Zhen Lyu here.
  - I am a journalism student who also falls for programming and problem-solving, currently majoring journalism and minoring computer science in NNU. 
  - During which time I went to Ryerson University for an exchange on New Media.
- 👀 I’m interested in media's mechanism as well as political issues. 
  - However, the fundamentals of a computer device also intrigue me a lot especially the sense of fully grasp on it when programming with Assembly/C.
- 💞️ The journey from Arts and Humanity school to a programmer who deal with bits and numbers is full of fun. 
  - Starting from simple Python project to process news report data, interests on fundamentals grows on me. 
  - The concepts of OOP, UML, Data Structure all suddenlly jam-packed to my world.
  - Indeed it's a long way, but I proceed.
- 📫 I sincerely hold tremendous desire to communicate with different minds and explore brand-new area. If you'd like to reach out for me, here is my contact information:
