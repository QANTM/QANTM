# 👋 Hi, Zhen Lyu here.
  - I am a journalism student who also falls for programming and problem-solving, currently majoring journalism and minoring computer science in NNU. 
  
  - During junior year I went to Ryerson University for an exchange on New Media area.
  
# 👀 Interested in media's mechanism as well as political issues. 
  - History, literature and philosophy have always been my favorite.
  
  - However, the fundamentals of a computer device also intrigue me a lot especially the sense of fully grasp on it when programming with Assembly/C.
  
# 💞️ The journey from Art School to a Programmer 
  - Balancing and maneuvering with multiple perspectives is fun, same thing for dealing with bits and numbers.
  
  - Starting from simple Python project to process news report data, interests on fundamentals grows on me. 
  
  - The concepts of OOP, UML, Multithreading... all suddenly jam-packed to my world.

  - Then I delve deeper and deeper on data structure, algorithms, operating system and computer architecture...
  
  - Indeed it's a long way, but I will proceed.
